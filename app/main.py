# ------------------------------

# add and configure redis on the environment
# implement redis library for queue (LIST, LPUSH, BRPOP or Streams + Consumerâ€¯Groups) and for caching (GET, SET, INCR, EXPIRE)
# implement service to use repository inserting (queue) and get data into/from redis
# implement repository to use redis
# implement grafana + prometheus for monitoring

# adjust/configure uWSGI
# use redis as a queue integrated with the both app instances (read-only) to handle instabilities and avoiding inconsistency
# insert into redis the payments to be processed and let one or more consumers handle them (with tenacity retrying + using the fallback payment processor)
# save/update on redis after each payment processing, then the summary will always be correct for both app1 and app2 APIs


# another option would be to use the app1 and app2 to handle the payment processing with yours workers
# since we can configure uWSGI to have a lot of workers, maybe we can process a lot of requests simultaneously
# but then I will need to worry about bottlenecks, because if the payments processors become unavailable for so long I'm going to have problems
# and also, have a lot of workers running is very heavy
